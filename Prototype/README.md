## Current State:
(20210313) This prototype was built in Microsoft Visual Studio utilizing the ASP.NET Core MVC Framework. The purpose of this prototype is to create a skeleton and page flow that the final product will eventually live on. The following mock up photos are taken of the ASP.NET MVC application running on my local machine. The HTML Files are dynamically generated via razor pages. These are DRAFT photos. THe final product will better utilize Bootstrap CSS files to format properly.

This mock home page demonstrates the simplicity of this app. The three basic functions are viewing and managing personal kitchen inventory, setting up menu item recipes that will parse the current inventory to notify the user what they have available to cook, and a calendar for scheduling meals and removing ingredient items from the inventory after completing the meal.
