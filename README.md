# Sous: Cloud Pantry Manger 

## Concept
Many families struggle with wasteful grocery shopping habits and have kitchen pantries that are far too full. Sous: Cloud Pantry Manager is a cloud-based solution to assist families who struggle keeping their food products organized. At the most basic level, Sous is a database inventory of all food related items located in a familyâ€™s kitchen. Information can be powerful, if leveraged properly, and Sous will allow users to make meaningful, time saving decisions based on their kitchen data with some key features.
